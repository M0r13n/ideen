# Paradigms overview

### Structured Programming
- removes `goto` statements
- replaces them with loops and branches
- `goto` statements prevent modules from being decomposed, thus prevent **divide and conquer** approaches
- allows modules to be recursively decomposed into small, provable units [[Dijkstra Testing shows the presenceof bugs| provable units]]

### OOP
- indirect transfer of control
- introduces constructors, local variables and methods
- removes functions pointers


### Functional programming
- introduces the concept of immutability
- that means discipline upon assignment


-> All three paradigms tell the programmer, **what not to do**
-> They don't tell, **what to do**
-> They takes away something from the programmer
-> All three combined would remove **everything**
