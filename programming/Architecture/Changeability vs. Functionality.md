# Changeability vs. Functionality

- a program that **works**, but that can not **change**, won't work if requirements change. It then becomes **worthless**
- a program that currently does not **fulfill the requirements**, but which can **easily be changed**, can be improved. So it remains **useful**
- taking [[Eisenhowers Matrix]] into consideration
	- software architecture is mostly **not urgent** but **important**
	- software features are mostly **urgent** but not **important**
	- -> Features are prioritized over architecture -> changeability decreases continually
