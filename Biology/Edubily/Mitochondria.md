# Mitochondria
Protein synthesis requires energy production (ATP).
Energy production requires protein synthesis.

Every metabolic process depends on protein synthesis:

- immune system
- Muscle growth
- Tendons and ligaments
- etc.


### Mitochondria

- Mitochondria produce energy in the form of ATP
- Mitochondria can be increased when there is a lack of energy
- A lack of energy can have different causes (sport, fasting, calorie restriction)
- `Lack of energy => more mitochondria`

### Metabolism
- Out metabolism distinguishes between two states at the cellular level:

- `Lack of food`:  
	- low on energy
	- `AMPK` goes up
	- `AMPK` slows down cell division and inhibits growth processes
	- `AMPK` triggers the creation of new Mitochondria
- ``Food abundance``: 
	- high on energy
	- `mTOR` goes up
	- `mTOR` triggers protein synthesis
	-`` protein synthesis => growth``
	
	### Insulin and `mTOR`
	- `Insulin` activates `mTOR`
	- `Amino acids` (protein) activates `mTOR`
