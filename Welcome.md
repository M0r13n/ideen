# Welcome to my brain
This is an ongoing project/experiment to digitize and interconnect all my notes.  This is a hierarchically structured collection of Markdown files that can be viewed with [Obisidian](http://obsidian.md) and/or a simple text editor.

## Warning
This is personal project and I do **NOT** strive for completion nor correctness. This is basically just a dump for ideas, notes and proof of concepts.

## Table of contents
I try to split the information by high level topics. 

- [Programming](./programming/Programming.md)
- [DevOps](./devops/DevOps.md)
- [Fundamentals](./fundamentals/Fundamentals.md)
- [Misc](misc/Misc.md)
- [Philosophy](./philosophy)
- [Quotes](./Quotes/Qoutes.md)
