# Welcome to my brain
This is an ongoing project/experiment to digitize and link all my notes. Formerly I was using a collections of Markdown files, that I organized in a GitHub repo. While this works, it is far from being perfect. Therefore I switched to Obsidian. 

## Warning
This is personal project and I do **NOT** strive for completion or correctness. This is basically just a dump for ideas.

## Table of contents
I try to split the information by topics. 

- [[Programming]]
- [[DevOps| DevOps]]
- [[Fundamentals/Fundamentals|Fundamentals]]
- [[Misc]]
- [[Qoutes]]
