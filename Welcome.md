# Welcome to my brain
This is an ongoing project/experiment to digitize and interconnect all my notes.  This is a hierarchically structured collection of Markdown files that can be viewed with [Obisidian](http://obsidian.md) and/or a simple text editor.

**⚠️ Warning:** This is a personal project and I do **NOT** strive for completeness nor correctness. This is basically just a dump for ideas, notes and proof of concepts.
