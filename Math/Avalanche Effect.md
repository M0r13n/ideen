# Avalanche Effect

The desirable property of cryptographic hash functions, wherein if can input is changed slightly (change a single bit) the output of the hash function/algorithm changes significantly.

- $$h(0b000) = 345763457834536$$
- $$h(0b001) = 908745656348345$$
- $$...$$
- $$h(0b111) = 7798756347864765$$
- *=> even if a single bit changes the output varies drastically*
