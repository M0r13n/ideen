There are **two** types of courts:
- **state courts**: one can raise any claim under state or federal law, except those that are under exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts
- **federal courts:** decide disputes involving the U.S. Constitution, federal laws, disputes between states, and disputes involving more than $75,000 between residents of different states

> The work of the federal courts often affects many people besides those involved in a specific lawsuit

At both the federal and state levels there are two kinds of courts: the **trial court** and the **appellate court**. The trial court's basic work is to ==resolve disputes by determining the facts and applying legal principles to decide who is right==. The appellate court's work is to ==decide whether the law was applied correctly== in the trial court, and in some cases, whether the law is Constitutional.

Federal trial courts are named **District Courts** while the **appellate court** is named **Court of Appeals.

## Supreme Court

The Supreme Court usually hears cases that have already gone through the federal Court of Appeals system, and sometimes state Supreme Courts.  ==But the Supreme Court is not required to hear every case==. In fact, is only hears a very small percentage of cases that is is asked to review. There are thousands of request and only about one hundred cases are heard every year. It is up to the nine judges to decided which cases they consider worthy.

Federal judges and Supreme Court justices are appointed by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate for a lifetime term.
