# Digital Services Act (DSA)

- similar to [Digital Markets Act (DMA)](Digital%20Markets%20Act%20(DMA).md)
- EU member states will need to empower their Digital Services Coordinators by 17 February 2024
- better protect consumers and their fundamental rights online
- establish a powerful transparency and a clear accountability framework for online platforms
- foster innovation, growth and competitiveness within the single market

## For Users

- **More transparency online**: Users should be empowered to understand why content is taken down and what they can do about it.
- **Limits on targeted ads and ads transparency**: The DSA restricts platforms' ability to capitalize on sensitive user information, such as ethnicity or sexual orientation.
- **Fast-track procedure for law enforcement authorities**: the DSA makes it easier for law enforcement authorities to uncover data about anonymous speakers, without adequate procedural safeguards


## Criticism

- [EFF](https://www.eff.org/pages/adoption-dsadma-notre-analyse)
	- gives way [too much power](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/02/enforcement-overreach-could-turn-out-be-real-problem-eus-digital-services-act) to government agencies to flag and remove potentially illegal content and to uncover data about anonymous speakers
- could prevent competition, because smaller companies can not afford strict content moderation
