# Digital Markets Act (DMA)

- started applying as of beginning of May 2023
- six months after the Commission decision to ensure compliance
- places new requirements and restrictions on online “gatekeepers”
- gatekeepers == largest tech giants
	- annual turnover of €7.5 billion
	- worldwide market valuation of €75 billion
	- at least 45 million monthly individual end-users and 10,000 business users
	- control one or more “core platform services” such as “marketplaces and app stores"
	- => Meta, Apple, Alphabet and Amazon
- restricts gatekeepers in several ways, including:
	- limiting how data from different services can be combined, 
	- banning forced single sign-ons, and 
	- forbidding app stores from conditioning access on the use of the platform’s own payment systems
	- allow third parties to inter-operate with the gatekeeper’s own services in certain specific situations
	- allow their business users to access the data that they generate in their use of the gatekeeper’s platform
- forbids to treat services and products offered by the gatekeeper itself more favourably in ranking than similar services or products offered by third parties on the gatekeeper's platform
- makes it easier for users to freely choose their browser or search engine
- forces companies to make unsubscribing from their “core platform services” as easy as subscribing was in the first place
- requires gatekeepers to inform the European Commission about their mergers and acquisitions
- fine of up to 10% of its total worldwide turnover (revenues)
- even harsher sanctions for repeated violations
-  likely the reason why Meta threads won't launch in the EU
	- data sharing between Instagram and Threads
	- access to instant messaging services
	- banned from combining users’ personal data across different platforms
