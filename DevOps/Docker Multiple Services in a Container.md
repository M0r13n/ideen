# Docker Multiple Services in a Container

According to the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/multi-service_container/):

> A container’s main running process is the `ENTRYPOINT` and/or `CMD` at the end of the `Dockerfile`. It’s best practice to separate areas of concern by using one service per container. That service may fork into multiple processes (for example, Apache web server starts multiple worker processes). It’s ok to have multiple processes, but to get the most benefit out of Docker, avoid one container being responsible for multiple aspects of your overall application. You can connect multiple containers using user-defined networks and shared volumes.
