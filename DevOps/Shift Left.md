# Shift Left

- **Goal:** guarantee software security
- effort to ensure software security at the earliest possible stages
- also known as DevSecOps
  - misleading -> implies security as a separate discipline
  - rather, security is part of Dev and Ops
- **shift left** testing to the early stages in the SDLC
  - find errors earlier
  - the later an error is found, the more expensive it is to fix it
  - continuous testing
- **shift left** security
  - design software with best practises in mind
  - identify vulnerabilities early on
- **shift left** gives developers/devops more responsibilities
- foundation of **iterative development**
