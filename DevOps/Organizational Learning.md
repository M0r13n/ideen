# Organizational Learning

> By removing blame, you remove fear; by removing fear, you enable honesty; and honesty enables prevention [Bethany Macri, Etsy Morgue tool]

>  Moreover, any local learnings are rapidly turned into global  improvements, so that new techniques and practices can be used by the  entire organization. We reserve time for the improvement of daily work  and to further accelerate and ensure learning. [The DevOps Handbook]

> Improving daily life routines is even more important than doing daily life routines. [The DevOps Handbook]
