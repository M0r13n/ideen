# Kaizen Blitz

Kaizen blitz, also known as kaizen event, is a small but comprehensive  and actionable **effort to identify areas for improvement** in a business  process and quickly **implement recognized solutions** effectively. As a  short-term process-improvement approach, it involves fewer people, is  executed within a few days, focuses on a specific area, and intends to  show visible results in a short period of time.

**Why use it?** We improve daily work by explicitly reserving time to pay down technical dept, fix defects, and refactor and improve problematic areas of our code and environments. This can be done by Kaizen Blitzes, which are periods when engineers self-organize into small teams to work on fixing any problem they want.
