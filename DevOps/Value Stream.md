For DevOps the **technology value stream** may be defined as the process required to convert a business hypothesis into a technology enabled service that delivers value to a customer.

As a DevOps engineer, my task is reduce the time and friction associated with bringing changes to production when an engineer checks a change into version control.

## Limit Work in Progress (WIP)

Context switches are expensive. This rules does not only apply to CPUs but also to humans.

Therefore, it should be the goal to reduce amount of work in progress as much as possible. Ideally, I work on a single piece of work at a time until it is complete.
