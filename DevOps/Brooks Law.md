# Brook's Law

is a principle in software project management, summarized as: "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later."

1. **Ramp-Up Time**: New team members require time to become productive and need training and orientation, which often involves significant time from experienced team members, thus reducing their productivity.
2. **Communication Overhead**: As more people are added to a project, the complexity of communication increases exponentially. Each new member adds additional communication channels, making coordination more difficult and time-consuming.
3. **Partitioning of Work**: There's a limit to how effectively a project can be divided into discrete tasks that can be worked on independently without requiring close communication. Some tasks are inherently sequential and cannot be accelerated through parallel work.
