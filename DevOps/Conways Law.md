# Conways Law

Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

— Melvin E. Conway

## Example(s)

Due to the lack of collaboration and communication, the development team may not fully understand the operational challenges and constraints faced by the operations team. Consequently, they may not prioritize certain aspects like scalability, monitoring, or error handling in their code.

The development team may prioritize fast feature delivery, potentially overlooking security vulnerabilities and lacking a complete understanding of security requirements. They might use outdated libraries and neglect proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, leaving the software susceptible to attacks. Simultaneously, the security team, operating independently, may lack visibility into the development process, conducting code reviews and security assessments only at later stages, causing delays in identifying and addressing security issues.

## Solution

By breaking down silos and fostering collaboration between development and security teams, they ensure that security requirements are considered and implemented throughout the development lifecycle.
