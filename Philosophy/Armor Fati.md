# Armor Fati

**_Amor fati_** is a [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") phrase that may be translated as "love of [fate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate "Fate")" or "love of one's fate". It is used to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one's life, including [suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering "Suffering") and [loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grief "Grief"), as good or, at the very least, necessary.

As such, it is a part of the stoic lifestyle because a true stoic approaches everything that life gives to them with reason and calmness. It is not worth suffering from loss or illness because these things lie outside of our control.
