- there are two main approaches to define an [[Ontology]] of computational systems:
	- distinct ontologies for software and hardware
	- layered methods of abstractions

## Software and Hardware

According to Moore no program exists as a pure abstract entity, that is, without a physical realization (a flash drive, a hard disk on a server, or even a piece of paper). In fact, every computer program can be viewed as both, as encoded instructions (software) and instructions stored at the physical level (Hardware). Theoretically, every program could be hardwired directly. The latter is especially true for special purpose built circuits.

## Method of Levels of Abstractions

There are many different forms of abstraction in the world of computer science. Code can be repeated during programming, by naming text and a parameter, a practice known as **procedural abstraction**. The object-orientated design pattern is based on abstractions from the common structures that are found in software systems. Such abstractions allow to define interfaces between the implementation of an object and its specification.

Abstractions can be piled upon each other to build more and more abstract concepts. On the other hand, abstractions can be used as a way to manage complexity. An Example for that is the [[TCP-IP-Model]].
