**[Theory X and Theory Y](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Y-Theorie#/media/Datei:Theorie_X.svg)** are theories of human work motivation and management.

**Theory X** assumes that the typical worker has little ambition, avoids responsibility, and is individual-goal oriented. He avoids any kind of responsibility. Thus, the manager has to specify each step of action in detail, vigorously guide and lead, and strictly control it.

**Theory Y** assumes that workers are intrinsically motivated and enjoy their work. They work best with minimal supervision while taking (full) responsibility for their actions. Thus, the manager does not need to closely supervise workers. Instead, he only guides and mentors them to lead them into the right direction in order to ensure efficiency and compliance.

Both management styles can be self fulfilling prophecies. Workers under close supervision with minimal creativity tend to be less motivated and show less engagement. This, in turn, leads to workers that do not take any kind of responsibility. Thus, the manager has to control the worker even more strictly.
