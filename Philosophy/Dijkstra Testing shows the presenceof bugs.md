**Testing shows the presence, not the absence, of bugs**

\- Dijkstra 

By writing tests, I can only prove my program to be incorrect, but never to be correct. In this regard software is like science: I can only prove provable statements false. Though by writing tests, I can only deem my program to be good **enough** - but never to be correct.
