- [Northcote Parkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Northcote_Parkinson)'s argument that ==an organization commonly gives disproportionate weight to trivial issues==
- also knows as ==bike-shedding==
	- Parkinson provides the example of the construction of a nuclear power plant
	- the responsible persons spent the majority of their time discussing the details of a bike shed
	- by doing so they ignored the the plan itself - which is much more important
- common example for endless discussions in which people implement their own proposal just ==to shown that they are knowledgeable and want to demonstrate commitment==
