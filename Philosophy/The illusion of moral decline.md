Nature published a [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06137-x) about the **illusion of moral decline**. The authors show that human kind perceives a moral decline since more than two thousands years. The authors show that people’s reports of the morality of their contemporaries have not declined over time, suggesting that the perception of moral decline is an illusion. Finally, they show how a simple mechanism based on two well-established psychological phenomena (biased exposure to information and biased memory for information) can produce an illusion of moral decline.

## Facts

- 2,000 years the historian Livy prophesied "_the final collapse of the whole edifice (deu: Gebilde)_"
- people clearly perceive moral decline (200k people over 70 years)
- slaughter and conquest, slavery and subjugation or murder and rape indicate immorality
	- decreased significantly over the last few centuries
- people’s reports of the current morality of their contemporaries were stable over time
- short: people perceive moral decline but this seems to be an illusion

## Why do people perceive this decline?

- humans are likely to [seek and attend to negative information](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1207/S15327957PSPR0504_2)
- mass media indulge this tendency with a disproportionate focus on negative news
- -> **negative biased exposure**
- [humans tend to forget negative events more easily](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797611419171)
- people believe that past morality was relatively high
- -> **biased memory effect**
