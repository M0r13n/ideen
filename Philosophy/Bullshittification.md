# Bullshittification

The (corporate) world seems to become increasingly bullshittificated. These are some examples for general rules or principles that may (or may not) explain why this happens:

## Shirky Principle

<mark>>> Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution</mark>

- an institution can be anything: people, companies, organisations, etc.
- instead of **fully solving** the problem, these institutions keep it around
- typically, these institutions depend on the existence of the problem
- the problem is their **raison d'etre**
- solving the problem would remove their reason for existence
- this is why government organisations can never be trusted 

## Parkinson's Law

<mark>>> Work expands so as to fill the time which is available for its completion</mark>

- Or more general: Work expands to consume all available resources

## Iron Law Of Bureaucracy

In every organisation there are two types of individuals:

1. those, who are devoted to the goals of the organisation
2. those, who are dedicated to the organisation itself

The <mark>second group always wins</mark>.
