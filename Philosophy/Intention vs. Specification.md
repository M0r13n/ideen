**Intention** refers to a cognitive state outside the computational system which expresses the formulation of a computational problem to be solved. Intentions articulate the criteria to determine whether a computational system is appropriate/correct. Thus, they are considered as the first [[Computational Systems#Method of Levels of Abstractions| Level of Abstraction]] of the computational system appropriate to that problem.

As a human I may express the need for a simple app to track my ToDos. This request expresses the intention to develop a computational system to be able to perform such a task. In order to gather such intentions techniques such as brainstorming, discussions or proof of concepts may be used.

It is important to note, that no reference on *how to solve the problem* is being made. Instead, only a description of the problem *that must/should* be solved is given.

A **specification** is a fully-fledged definition of an intentions in either natural or formal language. Typically, specifications are derived as advanced technical descriptions (natural language) from the stakeholders intentions. But they may also be formalized by a proper formal language (e.g. UML, BPNM, etc). Formal specifications are preferred in the context of formal development methods as they serve as the baseline for the verification of correctness of computational programs.

As specification of an ToDo app may require the creation of a database to store the ToDos. Means for the user create, read, update and delete such ToDos. The possibility to mark certain ToDos as done. To order Todos based on their relative priority. And so on.

The latter is then a natural specification of the intention of having a todo app.

A computer program is a *technical artifact* designed with the aim of fulfilling a specific **function**. Technical artifacts are human made objects that fulfill specific functions. As such they are different from *natural objects* (they are not natural by man made) and *artworks* (because they serve a specific purpose/function). There are two properties of technical artifacts:

- **Functional properties**: describe the functions of the artifact
	- what is the purpose of the artifact?
	- a screwdriver is built to (un)screw screws
	- a program may be written to add numbers
- **Structural properties:** describe the physical properties of an artifact
	- what is the artifact made of?
	- a screwdriver can be made out of different materials
	- a screwdriver can be manual or electric
	- a program can be written in many different languages and run on different hardware
