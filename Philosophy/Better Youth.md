# Better Youth

Is there any evidence that forced manual labour has a lasting positive  impact on the youth regarding moral, ethics and work ethos? I am  specifically thinking about compulsory military service or civilian  service. These are state-mandated enlistment of people for some kind of  service for the common good.

1. **Developmental and Psychological Theories**: Psychological theories such as 's stages of psychosocial development suggest that structured environments like those provided by compulsory service can aid in the development of virtues like fidelity, love, care, and wisdom. These environments may foster a sense of competence and achievement, contributing to better ethical and work attitudes.
2. **Empirical Research on Military Service**: Some studies have shown that military service, particularly when it includes comprehensive training and education, can lead to improved discipline, teamwork, leadership skills, and a sense of duty. For instance, research has indicated that veterans often exhibit higher levels of civic engagement and community service.
3. **Studies on National Service Programs**: Evaluations of civilian national service programs like AmeriCorps in the U.S. or the National Youth Service Corps in Nigeria have found benefits such as increased social cohesion, improved employment prospects, and enhanced civic engagement among participants.

### Historic Examples and Observations

1. **Post-World War II Reconstruction**: In many countries, post-war reconstruction efforts involved compulsory service in various forms. These programs often aimed to rebuild not only the physical infrastructure but also the social fabric of nations, fostering a sense of common purpose and shared responsibility.
2. **The Impact of Conscription in South Korea and Israel**: Both South Korea and Israel have compulsory military service. Observers have noted that in these countries, military service has contributed to national unity, a strong work ethic, and a sense of national pride and responsibility among citizens.
3. **Singapore's National Service**: Since its inception, Singapore's compulsory National Service has been credited with playing a crucial role in nation-building and instilling a sense of discipline, responsibility, and commitment to the country's youth.
