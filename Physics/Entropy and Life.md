# Entropy and Life



There is a hypothesis of the origins of life, the "dissipation-driven adaption".  This hypothesis states that random groups of molecules  can self-organize to more efficiently absorb and dissipate heat from the environment. The general idea is that life consumes low entropy (stored in chemical energy like food, soil,..) and dissipates it around (work, heat).

As the second law of [thermodynamics](./Thermodynamics.md) requires ever increasing entropy,  life shouldnâ€™t be unique but rather inevitable, as life in general would be the way for matter to better dissipate  heat, and better turn low entropy into high entropy.
