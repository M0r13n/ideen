# Some thoughts on Infinite Growth

- Infinite growth in a finite world is impossible, an incontrovertible fact we cannot escape.
- Humanity has long closed its eyes to this fact, and the consequences are evident today: a collapse of the planet within a few decades if we do not change our course.
- Technology will not help us, as the second law of thermodynamics shows that entropy tends to increase in an isolated system, leading to an inevitable loss of usable energy.
- The universe will eventually have a cold end, an icy, empty space with dead planets and burnt-out suns, a process taking billions of years but one where Earth is already pushing its limits.
- The only way to delay the inevitable end is the development of an interplanetary civilization, an extremely unlikely prospect.
- The Fermi Paradox raises further doubts, as the disparity between the high probability of extraterrestrial life and the absence of contact suggests the extremely unlikely development of complex civilizations.
- Despite conditions for life existing on several planets in our solar system, the development of complex civilizations seems to be a limiting factor.
- The development of life up to our stage as humanity happens frequently, but the leap to an interplanetary civilization seems practically impossible.
- Two possible explanations: the energy needed for interstellar travel exceeds the energy that can be gained, or resources on the home planet deplete before spacefaring civilizations emerge.
- Some researchers hope that no life is found on Europa, as this would prove life's high likelihood and consequently the inevitable end of humanity.
- This, in turn, suggests that every complex civilization likely failed due to its own growth.
- The current climate crisis is considered the greatest challenge, potentially more dramatic than World War II. Survival chances are viewed as 50:50.
- In the long term, the author sees no perspective for humanity and doubts that the present form of humanity will endure for several millennia.
