| Physical | Copper or optical fibre cables, 2,4 ghz network |

### Application layer
Protocols that enable applications to communicate and exchange **application specific** data.

### Transport layer
Enables end-to-end communication.

### Internet layer
Cares about the routing of packets. Point-to-Point connections. Each nodes only cares about the next destination for the packet.

### Data Link layer
The data link layer defines the format of data on the network. Control of how data is handled by the physical media through MAC (Media Access Control) and detection of errors.

### Physical layer
Responsible for transmitting the data over the different types of physical media that may be present.
