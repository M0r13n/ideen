# [RFC1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918)
- introduces private addresses
- these addresses are **not publicly routable**
- **neither are they globally unique**
- Why?
	- many hosts on a network do not require access to other hosts in other networks
	- some hosts may only need access to some services (ftp, smtp) to other networks
	- IPv4 address shortage
	- enormous routing overhead
- the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (**IANA**) has reserved the ==following three blocks== of the IP address space for private networks:
     - 10.0.0.0          -   10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)
     - 172.16.0.0       -   172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix)
     - 192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)
- ==private hosts **CAN** communicate with all other hosts inside the same network==
- ==private hosts **CANNOT** communicate to any host outside the network==
- in order for private hosts to communicate with other hosts on different networks [[NAT]] is required
