- ADHD can be considered afresh using an evolutionary lens
- ADHD symptoms might be understood to result from an ‘evolutionary mismatch’
- children were not expected to sit still and concentrate on academic tasks for many hours a day
- increases complexity of every day tasks?

## Interesting Facts

> There appear to be no discernible differences in the brains of infants with ADHD compared with those of unaffected infants

> however, by 6–8 years of age, children with ADHD had thinner cortices in the primary somatosensory area

==The question is then: Are these changes coming from our modern environment?==

> There are also cultural differences in diagnosis rates ([Reference Ghosh, Holman and PreenGhosh 2015)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bjpsych-advances/article/how-evolutionary-thinking-can-help-us-to-understand-adhd/A4BBE292EB44B2230294367A4ACB3F88#ref34), which might be explained by a range of factors. Some cultures place a  higher value on emotion regulation, for example, so that problems with  self-regulation is more common among US than Asian males

==More self-regulation might be two-sided sword==

> One can speculate that being a carrier of that novelty-seeking variant  might have aided the likelihood of survival by making such individuals  more predisposed to seek new pastures when danger loomed, and hence  survive to pass on this variant.

==Genetic predisposition==

> Thus, what we are seeing is that some children are born with more  genetic susceptibility for ADHD-type symptoms, but also that certain  kinds of environmental influence, such as cultural values or parenting,  including closely monitoring a child's behaviour, can hugely reduce the  potential effects of genes that otherwise might give rise to worrying  behaviours

==Predisposition does not mean that symptoms actually evolve?==

==Does this mean that symptoms are reversible?==

> Thus, children who grow up in difficult circumstances may be more  hyperactive and less likely to settle than children who are used to a  relaxed and calm environment

> Studies show that having a stressful or traumatic childhood is highly predictive of being impulsive

==maybe even illness? cancer?==

>  It is a strategy that ensures short-term survival, though at the cost of long-term physical and mental health

==bad experiences lead to adaption which makes them stronger?==

> However, the social environment for children has changed dramatically  over the past century or two. Whereas most boys would once have  typically learnt a trade from their father or another relative, this all changed with the professionalisation of schooling. One result is that  there is a mismatch between the strengths of children with ADHD – i.e.  their tendency to explore, to challenge and to try out new ways of doing things – and their environment (today's schools). ADHD is unusual in  that its diagnosis is most often made in the context of schooling, with  most cases being diagnosed in children between the ages of 6 and 12

==Schooling might not be good for everyone==

==sleep cycles?==



## Examples

Nine-year-old Joe, who was on a local authority child protection plan  because of neglect by his drug-misusing mother, was treated with  stimulant medication for ADHD. After he was placed in foster care, his  school work improved dramatically and he was able to stop his  medication. One of the reasons for this was that the ‘breakfast’ his  mother had assured professionals she was giving him with his stimulant  medication before school consisted of a can of caffeinated energy drink.

Seven-year-old Alfie was being treated with short-acting ADHD medication to cover him at school, but neighbours in the flat below complained  about his jumping around in the evenings and at the weekends. Members of the multidisciplinary team agreed that medication should not be  prescribed in this instance and decided to write a letter to the local  housing office instead.
