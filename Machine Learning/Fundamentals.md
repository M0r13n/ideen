> Machine learning is the field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed

Good tool for:

1. Problems that require a lot of fine tuning and rules: *Spam detection*
2. Problems without a good known solution: *Speech recognition*
3. Fluctuating environments: *Adapting Spam*
4. For getting insights into large complex amounts of data: *Data Mining*
