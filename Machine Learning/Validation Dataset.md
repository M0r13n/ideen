Validation datasets are used to prevent a model from being inadvertently overfitted â€” that is, train a model to work well only on our training data. 

The validation dataset is different from the training dataset in order to give us an estimate of the skill/capability of the model. It is also used to tune the hyper-parameters (can lead to bias the in the model).
