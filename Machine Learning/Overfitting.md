# Overfitting

Just like *overgeneralization* in humans (*"All taxi drivers are scammers"*), overfitting can happen in ML. It typically means, that a model performs well on the training data set, but does not generalise well. This may happen **if the model is too complex relative to the amount and noisiness of the training data**.

## Solutions

- simplify model
- increase available training data
- reduce noise in the training data
