# Quantization

Quantization is a technique used in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and  Machine Learning (ML) to make models more efficient and faster.  The goal could be to make a state of the art model executable on consumer hardware.

- **decreases the size of the model**: reduces the size of the AI models by simplifying the numbers they use, making them easier to store and share
- **speeds up calculations:** simplifies the calculations AI models have to do by using  smaller numbers, which means they can make decisions faster.
- **quality loss**: reduced precision and size results in a quality loss roughly proportional to the decrease in precision/size
