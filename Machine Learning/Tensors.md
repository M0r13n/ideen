- thought of as a generalized [[Matrix]]
	- matrices are two dimensional $m \times n$
	- tensors can be of any dimension
- dimension is called **rank**

## Transformation law

> A tensor is a mathematical entity that lives in a structure and interacts with other mathematical entities. If one _transforms_ the other entities in the structure in a regular way, then the tensor _must obey a related transformation rule_.

> So tensor is an n-dimensional array satisfying a particular transformation law. Unlike a matrix, it shows an object placed in a specific coordinate system. When the coordinate systems change, the entries of a tensor also transform in that way, such that the tensor still describes the same map in the new coordinate system.


- each type of tensor has a **transformation law**
	- define how the respond to change of basis
