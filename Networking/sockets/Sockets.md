## Sockets

A socket ...

	- acts as an endpoint for sending an receiving data
	- provides a programming interface (API)
	- is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two hosts

A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the  application that data is destined to be sent to.
