You find the original RFC [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1178).

## TL;DR
Choosing a good name for a machine is quite hard. By following  the guidelines outlined in the RFC one can find reusable, unique and self explaining names.  The most important (IMHO) rules are:

1. Do not overload common names
	- Imagine a machine called `up`. This might cause confusion:
		- `Is up down`
		- `Boot the machine up`
2. Do not use your own name
	- Does your dog share the same name as you?
	- What happens if you have multiple computers?
3. Avoid Domain names
4. **ONLY** use alphanumeric characters
5. Don't rely on cases. They might not be recognized by every machine.
6. Use rare words/names + theme names
	- Names of Tolkien characters (*Legolas*, *Melkor*, *Aragorn*, ...)
	-  Mythical People (*Zeus*, *Thor*, *Tereus*)
7. Only choose **real** names
